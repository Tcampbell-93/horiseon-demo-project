# horiseon-demo-project

## Description
This is a project where I recieved starter code and cleaned it up in order to learn more about semantic HTML. 
It a great start for learning the basics of HTML and CSS.
I learned a lot about different semantic elements and how to use them in combination with a css file. 
I also learned how to consolidate css classes in order to make the code more logical in structure.
I learned the importance of alt text for images and how to link nav tools in the page.
I learned how to write a README file and important elements to include in this file.

## Usage
At the top of the page there is three navigation links that will take you to different sections of the page.
